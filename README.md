# Leader board
In this project, I developed an application called "Leaderboard" that showcases scores submitted by various players. By simply clicking the refresh button, users can view the updated scores. The leaderboard presents the scores in descending order, from the highest to the lowest. Additionally, the application enables users to submit their own scores, contributing to the dynamic nature of the leaderboard.
